Mini Project - Error Handling in Shell Scripting 
Error handling is a crucial aspect of scripting that involves anticipating and managing errors that may occur during script execution. These errors could arise from various factors such as incorrect user input, unexpected system behavior, or resource unavailability. Proper error handling is essential for improving the reliability, robustness, and usability of shell scripts. 
1. # Implementing Error Handling 
When implementing error handling in shell scripting, it's essential to consider various scenarios and develop strategies to handle them effectively. Here are some key steps to think through ar implement error handling: 
2. # Identify Potential Errors
: Begin by identifying potential sources of errors in your script, such as user input validation, command execution, or file operations. Anticipate scenarios wherE errors may occur and how they could impact script execution. 

3. # Use Conditional Statements
: Utilize conditional statements (if, elif, else) to check for error conditions and respond accordingly. Evaluate the exit status ($?) of commands to determir whether they executed successfully or encountered an error. 

I TOOK A LOT OF TIME AND SERIES OF TEST AND I HAD SOME ERRORS AND SOME COMPLICATIONS ON THE WAY BUT THIS IS WHY WE DO WHAT WE DEVOPS OPERATORS HAVE TO DO 

HERE IS WHERE ARE SOME SNAPSHOT WHERE I RAN SOME COMANNDS LIKEE "CHMOD" AND ADD A SCRIPT AND INSTALLED SOME SOFTWARE E.T.C.
